# Learning About Linux

### Introduction
This document is the explanation about what i have learnt about the linux, which will cover Linux History, available distribution and the Linux commands.

### Section 1: Linux History
A Fennish student 'Linus Torvalds' created linux as a personal project. Later on it went popular as it was free and open source. Since the inital release of its code in 1991. It is in demand for today's market as it gives stability, security and flexibility. 

### Section 2: Linux Distributions
Linux distributions or "distro" is an operating system made from a group of software that includes kernerl and pakage management system. The most of the software that are used is free and open source. There are around thousand distribution available. below are some examples of it;
- **Ubuntu**: Known for its user-friendliness and large community support.
- **Linux Mint**: Aimed at providing a familiar experience for Windows users, Linux Mint is based on Ubuntu and emphasizes ease of use and stability.
- **CentOS**: A community-supported distribution derived from Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), CentOS is known for its stability and long upgrade cycles, making it popular for server environments.
- **Zorin OS**: Designed to be user-friendly, Zorin OS offers a Windows-like interface, making it an excellent choice for users transitioning from Windows to Linux.

Linux Mint, CentOS, and Zorin OS each cater to different user needs and preferences:

- **Linux Mint** is designed for users transitioning from Windows, offering a familiar interface and an emphasis on ease of use and stability, making it ideal for everyday desktop use.
- **CentOS**, on the other hand, is tailored for server environments, focusing on stability and long upgrade cycles, derived from Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
- **Zorin OS** also targets Windows users with a user-friendly interface that mimics Windows, facilitating a smoother transition to Linux.

### Section 3: Basic Linux Commands
Here are some basic commands I've learned:
- `ls`: Lists files and directories in the current directory.
- `cd`: Changes the current directory to the specified path. For example, cd Documents moves into the Documents directory.
- `pwd`: Prints the current working directory, showing the full path of where you are in the filesystem.
- `mkdir`: Creates a new directory. For instance, mkdir new_folder creates a folder named "new_folder".
- `cp`: Copies files or directories. 
- `mv`: Moves or renames files or directories. For example, mv old_name.txt new_name.txt renames a file.
- `rm`: Removes files or directories. Use cautiously; for example, rm file.txt deletes "file.txt".
- `sudo`: Executes a command with superuser (administrative) privileges, allowing changes that require higher permissions.

### Conclusion
Linux is an essential tool for anyone working in tech, especially in areas like servers, cloud computing, and cybersecurity. Its flexibility and open-source nature make it a powerful operating system for a wide range of uses.
